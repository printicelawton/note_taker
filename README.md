The Note Taker App is an ExpressJS application for entering notes into a database file. These notes can be to-do lists, reminders, or just general tasks that the user needs a record for.

The Note Taker App makes it simple and easy for the user to create, view, and delete notes.

When a user clicks 'Get Started' they are then directed to another page, which presents a list panel on the left and a container for creating and detailing notes.
